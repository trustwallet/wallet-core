  Audit the current branch's diff for backward-compatibility risk against persisted user data and wire formats. Use when a PR tightens validation, changes deserialization of stored data, modifies a wire/backup format, or changes which exception a public API throws. Outputs a structured markdown report to paste into a `[bc-check: ...]` PR comment.

You are auditing the current branch's diff against the configured base branch
(`origin/master` by default) for **backward-compatibility risk against persisted user
data and wire formats**. Find cases where this PR will reject, mis-parse, or
mishandle inputs that older versions of our own software already wrote to disk, to
backups, or onto the network.

**Do not trust the PR description's framing.** "Just a security fix" / "stricter
validation" is precisely the framing that hides this class of bug.

Before starting:

1. Read `docs/bc-footguns.md` if it exists. Every entry is a known constraint.
2. `git diff origin/master...HEAD` to get the full diff.
3. Identify which files are on persistence paths (see WalletCore context below).

### WalletCore persistence context

| Path                            | What lives there                                                    | Backup / off-device                                  |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/Keystore/`                 | JSON keystore files — user's encrypted private keys and mnemonics   | iCloud, Google Drive, manual export                  |
| `src/proto/*.proto`             | Protobuf `SigningInput` / `SigningOutput` wire formats              | Potentially stored by app layer                      |
| `include/TrustWalletCore/TW*.h` | Public C ABI — function signatures, enum values, exception types    | SDK consumers, compiled language bindings            |
| `registry.json`                 | Coin metadata: SLIP44 ID, derivation paths, address encoding, curve | Drives every derived address for all wallets         |
| `src/Keystore/StoredKey.cpp`    | Keystore load / save / migration logic                              | Same as Keystore above                               |
| `src/PrivateKey*`               | Private key encoding, validation, and signing entry points          | Keys serialized into keystore files                  |
| `src/PublicKey*`                | Public key parsing and validation                                   | Derived and stored in account records                |
| `src/HDWallet*`                 | HD wallet derivation — BIP32/39/44 logic                            | Drives all derived addresses; mnemonic import/export |
| `swift/Sources/KeyStore*`       | Swift-layer keystore read/write/migration                           | Same backup destinations as C++ keystore             |
| `swift/Sources/Wallet.swift`    | Swift wallet account type                                           | Serialized in Swift keystore JSON                    |
| `swift/Sources/Watch.swift`     | Swift watch-only account type                                       | Serialized in Swift keystore JSON                    |
| `wasm/src/keystore/`            | WASM/TypeScript keystore bindings                                   | Browser-side keystore files (localStorage, export)   |

**Blast-radius framing:** a bug in any of these paths means a user cannot decrypt their
wallet or derives wrong addresses → cannot access funds. Even a 0.01 % blast radius is
unacceptable. Treat BLOCKER verdicts as such.

Walk the 5 steps below. Cite file:line and commit SHAs everywhere.

### Step 1 — Classify

(a) Tighten input validation, (b) change parsing of a persisted format, (c) change
which exception type a public API throws, (d) remove an `if missing use default`
fallback, or (e) move validation earlier? If none → "No persistence risk", stop.

### Step 2 — Historical baseline

For each tightened rule:

- Could a prior version have *produced* data that violates the new rule? `git log -p`
  / `git blame` going back ≥2 years. Cite SHAs.
- Was there a partial migration ("regenerate on next user action")? Assume a
  non-trivial fraction of users **never triggered it**.
- Does the format ever leave the device? Backup / export / sync.

### Step 3 — Concrete failure scenarios

For every "yes": old client version → action that produced the data → where it
lives → exact upgrade code path (file:line) → user-visible symptom → blast radius.
No hand-waving.

### Step 4 — Red-flag checklist

Answer yes/no with file:line evidence:

**Generic:**

- New `throw` on read/load/decode/import path?
- Removed `if (field missing) use default`?
- New length/range/enum check on >1-year-old field?
- Constructor: lenient parse → parse + validate?
- Changed which exception type a public API throws?
- Format ever in backup/export/sync?
- Prior PR shipped "regenerate on next user action" partial migration? (cite SHA)

**WalletCore-specific:**

- Proto: field number reused or removed from an existing message?
- Proto: field type changed (e.g. `bytes` → `string`) or `required` added to existing field?
- Proto: enum value renumbered or removed?
- Keystore: JSON key renamed, removed, or made required without a default fallback?
- Keystore: `validate()` now called from the JSON-load constructor for the first time?
- Registry: `slip44`, `curve`, or address-encoding field changed? (changes derived addresses)
- Registry: `TWCoinType` enum value reordered or removed?
- C ABI: `TW*` function removed, renamed, or its return / exception behaviour changed?

### Step 5 — Required mitigations

- Accept legacy at read time, normalize on write *(preferred)*.
- Gate strict check behind "newly created" flag.
- One-time migration with explicit failure UX.
- Apply tightening to write paths only.

### Token rules for "Suggested PR comment"

| Verdict             | Valid token                                          | Invalid tokens  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| SAFE                | `[bc-check: Pass]`                                   | —               |
| RISK                | `[bc-check: Mitigated]` (after fix)                  | `Pass`, `N/A`   |
| RISK                | `[bc-check: Risk-Accepted]` (investigated, no fix)   | `Pass`, `N/A`   |
| BLOCKER             | `[bc-check: Mitigated]` (after fix)                  | `Pass`, `N/A`   |
| BLOCKER             | `[bc-check: Risk-Accepted]` (investigated, no fix)   | `Pass`, `N/A`   |
| No persistence risk | `[bc-check: N/A]`                                    | —               |

**`N/A` means the scanner fired on a file that has zero BC relevance** (a renamed
variable, a comment edit, a test fixture that happens to match the path filter). It
does NOT mean "I found a real BC issue but accept the risk." Using `N/A` when the
audit found a RISK or BLOCKER is incorrect and bypasses the gate dishonestly.

**`Risk-Accepted` is for cases where the finding is real but investigation confirms
the blast radius is effectively zero** — e.g. telemetry or team confirmation that
no user data in the wild can trigger the new restriction. It requires the same bar
as `Mitigated`: full audit output pasted, plus explicit evidence for why the risk is
acceptable (who confirmed it, what data or reasoning supports it). The audit trail
must be visible to reviewers.
