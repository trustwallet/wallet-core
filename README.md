Trust Wallet Core is an open-source, cross-platform, mobile-focused library
implementing low-level cryptographic wallet functionality for a high number of blockchains.
It is a core part of the popular [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com), and some other projects.
Most of the code is C++ with a set of strict C interfaces, and idiomatic interfaces for supported languages:
Swift for iOS and Java (Kotlin) for Android.
