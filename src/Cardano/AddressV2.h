/*
 * ADA Cardano
 * 
 * Address scheme V2 is supported, V1 not (but they are accepted as valid).
 * Derivation is BIP39, default derivation path is "m/44'/1815'/0'/0/0", with last element being the account number.
 * Curve is ED25519 with special variations, custom logic in HDWallet and TrezorCrypto lib.
 * Private key is ED25519: 32-byte PK is extended with 32-byte extra extension, and 32-byte chain code.
 * Private key is derived from mnemonic raw entropy (not seed, as in other cases); 96-byte secret is generated (pk, extension, and chain code).
 * Public key is 64-byte: the 32-byte ED25519 public key plus the 32-byte chain code of the PK.
 * Address derivation: Only V2, type 0 (=public key) addresses are generated.
 * - CBOR binary scheme is used inside addresses.
 * - root hash: The following CBOR data is hashed: [0, [0, pubkey64], {}], first SHA3_256, then Blake2B.
 * - attributes: CBOR encoding of an empty map ({}, empty in V2)
 * - address payload is CBOR encoding of [root, attributes, type=0]
 * - address data is CBOR encoding of [tag 24 (payload), CRC32(payload)]
 * - address is Base58 encode of address data.
 * 
 * Address compatibility:
 * AdaLite uses V1 with 12-word mnemonic phrases, V2 with 15-word phrases, and standard BIP39 derivation, with gap lookup.  
 * So AdaLite mnemonic wallets can be imported into TW, but default-12-word TW wallets cannot be imported to AdaLite, as it uses V1 for it.
 * Daedalus (official full node wallet) uses V1, non-standard derivation scheme, and non-sequential random account indexes.  Not compatible.
