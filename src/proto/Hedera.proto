// The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for
// appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in
// a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are
// submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with
// a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take
// effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The
// other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster,
// if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each
// transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes.
//
// Applicable to Scheduled Transactions:
//  - The ID of a Scheduled Transaction has transactionValidStart and accountIDs inherited from the
//    ScheduleCreate transaction that created it. That is to say that they are equal
//  - The scheduled property is true for Scheduled Transactions
//  - transactionValidStart, accountID and scheduled properties should be omitted

  // calls one or more HTS precompiled contracts; each of the "child" transactions spawned for a precompile has a id
  // with a different nonce.
